# This script assumes '${TARGET_DEPLOYMENT_BRANCH}' branch is the target deployment branch
#  note: in the case of standard github pages, this is is 'gh-pages')
#  note: in the case of a user github pages, this is is 'master')
# This script will deploy the CURRENT branch to TARGET_DEPLOYMENT_BRANCH

# Check if there are any changes which might need to be commited and prevent deployment

# Create the subtree
git subtree split --prefix ${DISTRIBUTION_DIRECTORY} -b ${TARGET_DEPLOYMENT_BRANCH}

# Becuase this is a 'force push' the branch must not be 'protected'
git push -f origin ${TARGET_DEPLOYMENT_BRANCH}:${TARGET_DEPLOYMENT_BRANCH}

# Remove the branch locally as its not needed.
# Deployment is simplified by re-creating the force pushing the branch
git branch -D ${TARGET_DEPLOYMENT_BRANCH}
