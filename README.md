# code-recipes
Bunch of code which is reusable but not useful enough as dependencies

This repo is a collection of reusable code, scripts and processes I've found useful for my own workflow and projects. Sometimes I'm not always with the same computer and would love to have similar setups wherever I go, so I put together this repository.

Documentation for some might be sparse and was really intended to refresh my own memory but if you find it useful and need help, feel free to ask :)

Feel free to use the stuff for whatever your needs are. If it makes at least one person's life better, I'm happy :)

## Organisation

I've tried to organise things via different use cases.
* front-end will often be related to client-side web tooling such as VueJS, React, Sass, Webpack etc...
* scripts are stuff that can often be executed via command line to automate repeated tasks
